Tables for shear-layer database
===============================

- TODO: Determine tables for fluid properties.

    - These can just mirror the flow quantity tables.

- TODO: Determine the correspondence between "flow points" and "model points".

    - Models correspond to the walls in internal and external flows.  They do
      not come into play in free-shear flows.  Each station can correspond to
      up to two model points, so for uniqueness model points should correspond
      directly to flow points at the wall (each wall point may have a single
      model point, in other words).  However, this poses a difficulty, since
      the model data must always contain the relevant flow points.  This also
      introduces the possiblity of some data redundancy, which should be
      avoided as much as possible.

- TODO: In some boundary layer studies, the model is the wind tunnel wall
  itself. 
  
    - In that case, each model can correspond to a particular facility
      component, but in general the database must not include full points for
      facility components.


## The data categories

- Data category

    - Fluids

    - Facilities

        - Facility components

    - Instruments

    - Models

        - Model points

    - Studies

        - Series

            - Stations

                - Points


## Quantities

- Given flow quantities

    - Identifier, either `study_id`, `series_id`, `station_id`, or `point_id`

    - Time, `time_id`

    - Fluid, `fluid_id`

    - Value type, `value_type_id`

    - Instrument, `instrument_id`

        - This only allows for one measurement per instrument, though, so
          repeated measurements with the same instrument cannot be represented
          here.  That may be an adequate design choice since I am concerned
          about how variations in the instrumentation affect the results.  Any
          variation with the same instrument is better represented through
          uncertainty quantification.

    - Mean value, `value`

    - Standard uncertainty, `uncertainty`

        - The mean value and standard uncertainty allow for standard
          uncertainty propagation.

    - Minimum value, `minimum`

    - Maximum value, `maximum`

        - The minimum and maximum values allow for uncertainty propagation
          using interval arithmetic.  They also provide an additional check on
          other values.  Note that for uniform distributions, the mean value is
          the average of the minimum and maximum values, but using two separate
          values, rather than merely some kind of "uncertainty" centered around
          the mean, allows for more information about the probability
          distribution to be represented in a simple manner.

    - Correction status, `corrected`

        - TODO: Is this needed?

    - Outlier status, `outlier`

- Calculated flow quantities

    - These may have additional quantities and may be more complicated.
