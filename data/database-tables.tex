\chapter{Database tables}

To interact with the database at a low-level (without the Python module), you
must know what each table is and what the text codes mean.  This chapter serves
as a quick reference for the tables and codes.


\section{Measurement techniques}

The database stores measurement techniques in a classification scheme to allow
researchers the option to select entire classes of measurement techniques
easily.  For example, using the classification, it is possible to form SQL
queries to find all hot wire measurements without specifying the type of hot
wire measurement (constant-current or constant-temperature).

That said, the current classification scheme is both ad hoc and temporary.  I
would prefer an existing standard but have been unable to find one fit for this
purpose.  Researchers should be warned that the current scheme may change over
time.
