\chapter{Database design}

\section{Goals}

\begin{itemize}

\item

Use SQLite as the database backend.  The goal here is to ensure that it
is possible to use SQL commands to select and find data.

The identifiers are intentionally simple and systematic so that it is possible
to extract information about profiles from the points (and in other
combinations).

\item

Use the Python package called \texttt{uncertainties} to handle uncertainties.
The uncertainties will be standard uncertainties (standard deviations of the
distribution of ``reasonable'' values from the measurements).

\item

Store the data as generic records.  This means that each data point in a flow
is merely a record in a particular table depending on its type.  This design is
flexible; it can store different data for the same variable easily, including
data for different averaging systems and measurement techniques.

Group data into 4 main categories:

    \begin{enumerate}

    \item Study data (data that applies to an entire study).

    \item Series data (data that applies to a series of profiles, like drag
    coefficients, etc.).

    \item Station data (data that applies to a single profile, like the
    momentum thickness)

    \item Point data (data that applies to a single point in a flow, like the
    local unweighted averaged velocity)

    \end{enumerate}

\item Eliminate redundancy in the tables.  Each data point MUST have one and
only one location.

Remember that at least some of the ``structure'' here really is ``data''.
Prefer data over structure, since data is mutable (or at least more easily
mutable).

Specifying the measurement techniques allows for all assumptions underlying
that data to be specified as well for each record in the database.

\item

Use assertions and other checks on the data.

\item

Include additional fields for commentary (likely editorial commentary).  Also
include additional fields for the people involved, the facilities involved, the
organizations involved, locations of any experiments, and any contract numbers.

\end{itemize}
