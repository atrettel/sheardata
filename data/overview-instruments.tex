\chapter{Overview of the instruments and methods}


\section{Instrument classification}

The database stores instruments and methods to gather data (experimental
measurement techniques or numerical methods) in a classification scheme to
allow researchers the option to select entire classes of instruments easily.
For example, using the classification, it is possible to form SQL queries to
find all hot wire measurements without specifying the type of hot wire
measurement (constant-current or constant-temperature).

That said, the current classification scheme is both ad hoc and temporary.  I
would prefer an existing standard but have been unable to find one fit for this
purpose.  Researchers should be warned that the current scheme may change over
time.
