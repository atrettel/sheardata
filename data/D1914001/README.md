- The units of velocities are cm/s.  The units of diameters and lengths are cm.
  The units of temperature are degrees C.

- "Surface friction" refers to the average wall shear stress.

- The "friction coefficient" is the average wall shear stress divided by the
  product of the density and the mean velocity squared.

- The friction data for oil is given in both files for redundancy.  However,
  the data in `surface_friction_measurements_oil.csv` should be used for
  uncertainty quantification, for greater precision.

- The temperature for the air flow test using the steel pipe is not given, but
  the kinematic viscosity value is consistent with 16.6° C.  This value is used
  in the CSV file.
