# 1929, Thomas E. Stanton, external flow experiments on cylinders

- When using the data, cite `StantonTE+1929+eng+RPRT`:

    > Stanton, Thomas Edward (1929). “On the effect of air compression on drag
    > and pressure distribution in cylinders of infinite aspect ratio”.
    > English. In: *Aeronautical Research Committee Reports and Memoranda*
    > 1210.

- The diameter of cylinder in `globals.csv` is given in centimeters.  The angle
  given in `pressure_coefficients.csv` is given in degrees.

- The results should be symmetrical, so the asymmetry measures the data
  quality.

- The data at 360° disagrees with 0° for the Mach 0.255 case, though this
  appears to be a typo.  The CSV file ignores the 360° data.
