## 1951, V. E. Senecal of Carnegie Institute of Technology, duct flow experiments

- When using the data, cite `SenecalVE+1951+eng+THES` (dissertation) or
  `SenecalVE+1953+eng+JOUR` (journal article).

- See page 62 of the dissertation for the definitions of the symbols used.

- Impact tube diameter study

    - There are charts in the text and later with the rest of the data tables
      on this subject.

- Friction factor data, from pages 75 to 85 and 87 to 92 of the dissertation.

    - Some runs correspond to velocity ratio runs, but the correspondence is
      only given on pages 134 to 140.

- Velocity ratio data, from pages 86, 126, and 128 to 133 of the dissertation.

    - The run identifiers for the velocity ratio data and the velocity
      distribution data match in some cases and correspond to some of the
      velocity ratio cases, though there are many velocity ratios without any
      corresponding velocity distribution measurements.

    - Page 127 does not appear to exist.

    - For run LI, test numbers 6 and 7 are given as 4 and 5, but are really 6
      and 7 from run L.  The runs are the same.  The numbers have been changed
      to 6 and 7 to match run L.

    - Reynolds numbers for identical runs LX and LXI do not match completely
      but are close.  The values were changed to match run LX.

- Velocity distribution data, from pages 93 to 125 of the dissertation.
